# Sayori

Sayori is a dead simple command router based on [discordgo](https://github.com/bwmarrin/discordgo).
Typically, command syntax for Discord Bots look something like `[prefix][alias] [args]`.
Sayori makes this easy by breaking down a command into different components that will be used for handling.

V2 of Sayori includes subcommand support.
